There are a few ways of representing functions but the **standard function notation** is one representation that facilitates working with functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To represent \"height is a function of age,\" we start by identifying the descriptive variables $h$ for height and $a$ for age. The letters $f$, $g$, and $h$ are often used to represent functions just as we use $x$, $y$, and $z$ to represent numbers and $A$, $B$, and $C$ to represent sets.\n",

    "\n",
    "We can also give an algebraic expression as the input to a function. For example $f(a+b)$ means \"first add $a$ and $b$, and the result is the input for the function $f$.\" The operations must be performed in this order to obtain the correct result.\n",
